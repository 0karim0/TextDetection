The code then defines two functions:

detect_text: This function detects text in an image using EasyOCR.
draw_box: This function draws the bounding boxes and text on an image.


The detect_text function first creates a GPU-accelerated reader. 
Then, it detects text on the image using the readtext method. The readtext method returns a list of text detections, each of which is a tuple of (bbox, text, score). 
The bbox is a tuple of the coordinates of the bounding box of the text, the text is the detected text, and the score is the confidence score of the detection.

The draw_box function iterates over the text detections and draws the bounding boxes and text on the image. 
The rectangle method draws a rectangle on the image, and the putText method draws text on the image.

The code then defines the main function. The main function first reads the image from the specified path. Then, it calls the detect_text function to detect text in the image. 
Finally, it calls the draw_box function to draw the bounding boxes and text on the image. The code then plots the image and shows it.
